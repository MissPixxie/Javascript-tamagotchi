# School project, tamagotchi made in vanilla Javascript.
I'm a 90's kid that had a dozen tamagotchi's so when we got free hands in our examination project in my first course in Javascript, I thought that it would be fun to recreate my childhood.
The tamagotchi has 3 moods that get triggered by interacting and time.

### You can feed it different items that gives different values to the mood.
